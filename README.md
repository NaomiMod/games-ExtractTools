# Naomi Model Extractor

**Important**:

Naomi Model Extractor will scan any game binary files for NaomiLib models and extract them.
You can obtain your legally own game .GDI file and open it with GD-ROM Explorer, inside you will find multiple files thatmay contain game models.

If you are unsure which file contain models, you can extract them all to any temporary folder and start scanning!

# FAQ:

1) Where are textures?

Textures are usually stored in separate archives without any header.
For this reason you can find specific Game-specific scripts to extract textures and other resources from your game.


2) Why models are separate into many pieces?

Depends by how they are stored in game, especially character models are often split into several pieces, so you'll have to manually re-assemble them


3) I want X game music/textures/videos

You can request it as a wishlist, if it gets mant requests there's an higher chance for me looking at it!
